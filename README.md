🩺 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using various machine learning algorithms.
It involves a complete end-to-end ML pipeline — from data analysis to model deployment readiness.

🚀 Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify patients who are likely to suffer from heart disease, helping doctors in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

📊 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Exploration & Understanding

Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand the dataset

Explained each feature/column in detail

Checked for missing values, data distribution, and outliers

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and categorical encoding

Applied scaling and normalization where required

Used Label Encoding for categorical variables

3️⃣ Data Visualization

Created static plots using Matplotlib

Built interactive visualizations using Plotly for deeper insights

Analyzed relationships between heart disease and major factors like age, cholesterol, chest pain, etc.

4️⃣ Model Training

Trained 10 different machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Gradient Boosting

AdaBoost

LightGBM

5️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning

Used GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for each model

Compared performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

6️⃣ Model Selection

Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and performance metrics

Re-trained the best model with optimized hyperparameters

Saved the final model using pickle for future deployment

🧩 Tech Stack

Languages: Python 🐍

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📈 Results

The model with the highest accuracy achieved (RandomForeastClassifier , accuracy = 88%)



💾 Future Work

Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask

Integrate with a real-time health dashboard

Experiment with deep learning models for improved performance
